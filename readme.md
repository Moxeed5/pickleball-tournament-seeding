### Tournament seeder for on the fly tournaments

## Problem - Currently many pickleball tournaments do not use any form of seeding which results in good players being prematurely eliminated in the tournament while less skilled players progress to further rounds. This is not fun for anyone because a good player may ultimately only play mediocre players throughout the whole tournament, even though there were other potential matchups with good players.

## Solution - On the fly tournament seeding. After the first round of these open tournaments, winning teams will be seeded based on how many points they gave up in their first match. In double elim, losing teams will be seeded by how many points they scored in their first match. In this way, we can ensure that strong teams are facing weaker teams in the earlier tournament rounds.

## Expected outcome - There will be a higher quality of play later in the tournament because stronger teams were faced against each other prematurely. Higher quality play will lead to a more productive and ultimately better tournament experience for talented players.
